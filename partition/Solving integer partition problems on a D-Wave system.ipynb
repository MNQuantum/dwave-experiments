    "# Solving integer partition problems on a D-Wave system\n",
    "\n",
    "**Authored by David Radcliffe (dradcliffe@gmail.com) on March 13, 2023.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The **integer partition problem** is as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "> Given an list of integers, split the list into two parts having equal sums. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the list [15, 20,  8,  5,  9,  9]\n",
    "can be split into two parts, [15, 9, 9] and [20, 8, 5]\n",
    "each summing to 33.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is NP-complete, so there is no known efficient algorithm that can solve it in general. However, if the integers are not too large, the problem can be solved efficiently using a dynamic programming, and there also exist efficient approximate algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical application is scheduling a set of independent tasks between two processors so that the total processing time is minimized. Considering our previous example, suppose that we have six tasks, requiring 15, 20, 8, 5, 9, and 9 minutes, respectively. Then we could assign the first task and the last two tasks to the first processor, and the remaining three tasks to the second processor. The first processor completes its tasks in 15 + 9 + 9 = 33 minutes, and the second processor completes its tasks in 20 + 8 + 5 = 33 minutes, so this is an optimal allocation of tasks between the two processors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we attempt to solve integer partition problems on a D-Wave system, using a hybrid (quantum and classical) algorithm. The D-Wave system is not a universal (gate-based) quantum computer, but rather a quantum annealer. It is unknown whether such devices are able to solve combinatorial problems more efficently than a classical computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** You will need to install the [dwave-system](https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/projects/system/en/latest/index.html) package and obtain an [API token](https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/stable/overview/sapi.html) to run this notebook.
